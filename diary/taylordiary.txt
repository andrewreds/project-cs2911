We meet to dicuss the various ideas for the project and decided on a class structure for the maze which I have been assigned to make as soon as possible. This class structure will include:

Maze - The maze constructure and container class
Cell - A class that contains the walls of a cell
Wall - The walls of a cell
Player - A player is an object that can travel 
PlayerTail - A recording of a the path followed by the player
